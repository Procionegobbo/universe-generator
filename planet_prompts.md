# Planet Image Generation Prompts

This document contains a curated list of AI image generation prompts for all planet types supported by the Stellar Universe Generator. These prompts are designed to produce high-quality, scientifically-inspired, and visually stunning astronomical assets.

## Artistic Style Guidelines
- **Art Style**: Photorealistic Astronomical Photography (Space Engine / NASA / James Webb Style)
- **Background**: Deep space, distant nebulas, starfields, or black background for isolation.
- **Lighting**: Realistic planetary illumination, atmospheric scattering, shadowing.
- **Resolution**: 4k, high detail, sharp focus on the planet.

### Planet Types

#### Asteroid Belt (A)
> **Prompt**: A dense, sprawling asteroid belt in deep space. Countless rocky bodies of various sizes, some with craters and metallic glints, orbiting a star. Dust clouds and subtle light scattering. High detail, photorealistic, cosmic background.

#### Gas Giant (G)
> **Prompt**: A massive gas giant planet with swirling, colorful cloud bands and a prominent storm. Shades of orange, brown, and white, with faint rings and several small moons in the distance. Realistic atmospheric depth, 4k, space photography style.

#### Rocky Planet (R)
> **Prompt**: A rugged, rocky planet with a cratered surface, mountains, and canyons. No visible atmosphere, sharp shadows, and a barren, desolate appearance. High-resolution, photorealistic, isolated on black background.

#### Carbon Planet (C)
> **Prompt**: A rare carbon planet with a dark, graphite-black surface and diamond-like glints. Subtle blue or purple atmospheric haze, jagged terrain, and reflective patches. Cinematic lighting, deep space background.

#### Desert Planet (D)
> **Prompt**: A dry, arid desert planet with vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and minimal vegetation. Warm ochre and tan colors, thin atmosphere, and dust storms visible. High detail, realistic planetary photography.

#### Hell Planet (H)
> **Prompt**: An extreme hell planet with a scorched, volcanic surface. Rivers of lava, erupting volcanoes, and a thick, toxic atmosphere glowing red and orange. Intense heat distortion, dramatic lighting, space background.

#### Molten Planet (M)
> **Prompt**: A young, molten planet with a glowing, partially liquid surface. Bright orange and yellow magma flows, volcanic eruptions, and a thin, smoky atmosphere. High contrast, photorealistic, cosmic setting.

#### Earth-like Planet (E)
> **Prompt**: A vibrant, Earth-like planet with blue oceans, green continents, white clouds, and polar ice caps. Lush, life-supporting appearance, realistic atmospheric scattering, and visible weather patterns. 4k, space photography, isolated on black background.

#### Unknown Planet Type (#)
> **Prompt**: A mysterious, undefined planet shrouded in shadow and mist. Indistinct surface features, ambiguous color palette, and an enigmatic aura. Cinematic, high detail, cosmic background.

### Usage Tips
- Use these prompts in tools like **Midjourney**, **DALL-E 3**, or **Stable Diffusion**.
- For better UI assets, add `--no border frame` or "isolated on black background" if your generator requires clean transparency.
