# Stellar Image Generation Prompts

This document contains a curated list of AI image generation prompts for all star classes supported by the Stellar Universe Generator. These prompts are designed to produce high-quality, scientifically-inspired, and visually stunning astronomical assets.

## Artistic Style Guidelines
- **Art Style**: Photorealistic Astronomical Photography (Space Engine / NASA / James Webb Style)
- **Background**: Deep space, distant nebulas, starfields.
- **Lighting**: Intense volumetric glow, lens flares, corona effects.
- **Resolution**: 4k, high detail, sharp focus on the star.

### Main Sequence Stars

#### Class O (Blue Supergiant)
> **Prompt**: A massive, intensely glowing Class O blue supergiant star in deep space. Brilliant electric blue core with a violent, energetic celestial corona. Intense solar flares and plasma loops emerging from the surface. 4k, hyper-realistic, astronomical photography style, cosmic rays, distant nebula background.

#### Class B (Blue Giant)
> **Prompt**: A bright Class B blue giant star. Vivid azure and cyan hues, smooth but powerful stellar surface. Radiant sapphire glow, soft light dispersion in the surrounding vacuum. High resolution, space photography, minimal starfield.

#### Class A (White Star)
> **Prompt**: A pure white Class A star, radiating a clean, intense white light. Subtle silver and pale blue undertones in the corona. Sharp, high-contrast stellar disk against the blackness of space. Cinematic lighting, sharp focus.

#### Class F (Yellow-White Star)
> **Prompt**: A stable Class F yellow-white star. A blend of warm cream and bright white light. Active sunspots and subtle granulation visible on the surface. Realistic solar atmosphere, 8k resolution, astronomical accuracy.

#### Class G (Yellow Dwarf - Sol Type)
> **Prompt**: A classic Class G yellow dwarf star, resembling the Sun. Vibrating golden-orange surface with dynamic solar prominences. Detailed convection cells, warm solar wind, realistic James Webb telescope style.

#### Class K (Orange Dwarf)
> **Prompt**: A warm Class K orange dwarf star. Deep amber and burnt orange color palette. Soft, inviting glow with a thick, visible chromosphere. Cinematic space art, high detail, realistic physics.

#### Class M (Red Dwarf)
> **Prompt**: A dim, smoldering Class M red dwarf star. Dark crimson and ruby red surface with high magnetic activity. Smaller than other stars, intense dark red solar flares. Eerie, atmospheric lighting, deep space.

### Giants and Supergiants

#### Giants (gF, gG, gK, gM)
> **Prompt**: A colossal [COLOR] giant star, filling the frame. Thin, translucent outer atmosphere (photosphere) showing internal churning of plasma. Massive scale compared to distant starfields. Intimidating size, soft volumetric lighting.
> *(Replace [COLOR] with: Creamy-White for gF, Golden for gG, Amber for gK, Deep Red for gM)*

#### Supergiants (cB, cA, cF, cG, cK, cM)
> **Prompt**: A hyper-massive [COLOR] supergiant star. A chaotic, turbulent celestial body with an unstable, bloated atmosphere. Violent bursts of plasma and heavy solar winds. Epic scale, astronomical majesty, high-speed solar particles visible.
> *(Replace [COLOR] with corresponding base class color)*

### Degenerate and Exotic Objects

#### White Dwarfs (DA, DB, DF, DG, DK)
> **Prompt**: A tiny, incredibly dense White Dwarf star. Small as a planet but glowing with blinding [COLOR] intensity. Sharp, crystal-like clarity, high gravity distortion effects in the nearby space. Minimalistic, powerful glow.
> *(Replace [COLOR] with: Pure White for DA, Pale Blue for DB, Lilac for DF, Mint for DG, Pale Yellow for DK)*

#### Neutron Star (NS)
> **Prompt**: A pulsar-style Neutron Star. A small, rapidly spinning core of pure energy. Intense twin jets of radiation shooting from the poles into deep space. High magnetic field distortion, blue and purple lighting, lightning-like plasma arcs.

#### Black Hole (BH)
> **Prompt**: A scientifically accurate Kerr Black Hole with an accretion disk. A dark void surrounded by a swirling, glowing ring of superheated matter. Gravitational lensing warping the background stars. Interstellar movie style, cinematic, photorealistic, 8k.

### Usage Tips
- Use these prompts in tools like **Midjourney**, **DALL-E 3**, or **Stable Diffusion**.
- For better UI assets, add `--no border frame` or "isolated on black background" if your generator requires clean transparency.
